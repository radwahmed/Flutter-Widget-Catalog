# üé® Flutter Widgets Playground

This project is a **personal playground** for experimenting with advanced Flutter widgets and effects.  
Instead of focusing on the basics, the goal here is to explore **new widgets** for me, practice animations, and try creative UI techniques.

## ‚ú® What I Experimented With
- **Animations**  
  - `AnimationController` with custom tweens  
  - Chained animations (e.g., loading dots)  
  - Scale, fade, and transform effects  

- **Creative Backgrounds & Effects**  
  - `BackdropFilter` for blurred glass effects  
  - Gradient backgrounds with glow/lighting  
  - Adding stars, custom shapes, and layered effects  

- **Clipping & Custom Shapes**  
  - `ClipPath` for wavy designs  
  - Custom shapes with `CustomPainter`  
  - Rounded / irregular image clipping  

- **Transformations**  
  - Rotating, scaling, and skewing widgets with `Transform`  
  - Combining transforms for unique layouts
